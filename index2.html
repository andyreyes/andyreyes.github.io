                            I wanna thank you for sticking by me, getting to know my life, showing me the most sincere support and unconditional love. I couldn't thank you enough for the countless amount of times that you have stuck by me when I needed you. I have no idea what I'd do without you sometimes... or all of the time. And I am so happy that I don't ever have to find out.

                            I’m not sure there will ever be adequate words to describe the impact you have had on my life. So many people talk about being friends forever, yet their plans always seem to fall through. I am more sure of our friendship than most things in life, and for that reason I KNOW that we will survive the test of time. At this point, so much of you is part of me that we couldn’t really be separated if we wanted too. You truly are my other half. If I ever chose to spend my life with someone, my husband/boyfriend will have to accept that you own part of my heart as well. You have been through it all with me, and that is not something I take lightly. We’ve seen each other at our best and worst, and still chose to stick around.
