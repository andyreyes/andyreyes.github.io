                            Words cannot fathom how grateful and proud I am to be called your daughter. I couldn’t thank you enough for showing us what unconditional love is. You always put our happiness  before your own. I never thought that unconditional love exists but your love truly is a living proof that love has no boundaries. Every time you’re around, everything seems right.

                            I could still remember the day when I was just a little child, learning how to read and count. You were my first teacher, in the morning, you would walk me to school and kiss me goodbye before you're off to work, and when I arrived home in the afternoon, we would do our homework together while you nag me to focus more on studying and I should start to learn how to read by then. Day and night, you taught me patiently. On bed time, I would lay down beside you and taught me how to pray after that you would sing children songs for me until I fall asleep—and mom, I thank you for that. Thank you for loving me when I am not so lovable. Thank you for lifting me up when I am at my lowest; thank you for being my number one fan. Thank you for raising me with such kindness. Thank you for teaching me not to settle for anything else. Thank you for knowing my worth even the world doesn’t. Thank you for believing in me when I don’t even believe myself. Thank you for staying and I know you’ll never go even the world turns its back on me and most importantly thank you for the unconditional love that you always show everyday. I’m sorry, if it’s taking me a long time; you deserve the world and I would give it to you even if it means to move heaven and earth.
